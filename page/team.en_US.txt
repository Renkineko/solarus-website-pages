# Solarus Team
## History
Solarus is developed by a team of Zelda-lovers on their free time, as a hobby. It begins back in time, in 2002 to be exact, in France, when Christopho, the creator and main contributor of Solarus, created a website for its first game : Zelda-Solarus, still active today. It was a way to promote the first version of Mystery of Solarus, which he made with RPG Maker.
## Team
Solarus is an open-source project, so the people contributing make the community. However, the creator, and main contributor since the beginning of the project, is Christopho. Around him, you can find a small team of people helping for the engine, the quest editor, the website and the games.
