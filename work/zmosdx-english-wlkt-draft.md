-- CHAPTER 2 -- FOREST DUNGEON (LEVEL 1)


At first, get off the platform and lift the vase in the lower left corner. The switch below will open the door to the north. Once the door is over, it closes behind you. To reopen it, it will be necessary to raise the vase to the north by going up the staircase and to pass on the switch, but before lift the vase to your immediate right. A chest appears, giving you the **Map**. Then walk along the left wall, paying attention to the holes, and go to the room to the east. Note the crack north of the wall, behind hides the Piece of Heart #07 that you can get as soon as you get the Bombs. Kill the Popos until you get a **Small Key**. Then go down to the entrance and turn the door on the right. In this room, kill all the enemies to reveal the chest containing the **Compass**, then go down the stairs of this same room. 

Once on this new floor, clean the map but do not touch the jars that trap the Bubble. This room is about finding a way to take the trunk located behind the three trapped soils. For this, you will have to place the blocks so that you can not be deported from the corridor. Once the housework is finished, start by pushing the block closest to your arrival according to the route indicated on the map. It is better to start by placing it on the top right of the treadmills to avoid any unfortunate blocking. Once the first block is placed, drag the second block into the left door. Once this new block to destination, go get the last block in the northwestern room. Kill the Popo if you have not already done so, flip the crystal lever to retrieve the Crescent into the chest blocked by the blue pads, then slide the block to the vases. There, the Bubble may be embarrassing. To minimize the breakage, it is advisable to proceed one vase per vase. First, remove the vase from the top left corner and place the block. Then, when the Bubble deviates from the path of the next vase you are aiming for, destroy the vase and quickly slide the block into it. He is now trapped and you can still move the block one step down (or to the right if you have destroyed the vase at the bottom of the first one). At this point, your block is in the inner square of the vases, in the upper left corner. The next step will force you to release the Bubble by breaking a vase, no matter which (preferably the one on the path between the block and the door), and once the Bubble is released you must not be discouraged by the blows that he can give, and always push the block until it reaches the door. Remember that it is faster to push the block by holding the action key than to advance. Once in the door, you are safe and you can finish the journey as with the second block. By doing well, you can avoid the Bubble completely or get away with two shots maximum. A fairy awaits you in a short time if you feel a little low in energy. 

Once the riddle of the blocks is complete, you get the **Big Key**. Reactivate the crystal switch so that the blue is up and the orange is down. The room on the right contains a switch that opens the door to the north on the last vase in the row. The next room contains vases with hearts and a fairy. If you can, store the fairy, because there are enough hearts under the other vases to give you your whole life. Go to the upper floor, then a second time. You arrive in Khorneth Hall, the mini-boss of the dungeon. 

MINI-BOSS: KHORNETH

Khorneth is not a very difficult enemy. His weak points are in his wings and then his body. Four shots at each wing, and five shots at the body will get the better of him. If you have trouble touching it because it is constantly moving, wait for it to come to a stop to give you a wing shot: the magnitude of the movement means that you should be able to touch it while being far enough to dodge it. he comes to you. Note that for the moment, its wings are insensitive to the loaded blows (they do not do twice as much damage as it should). 

Once Khorneth is destroyed, continue on the next T Hall, and fork down. The jars contain once again hearts and fairies. Get out of the dungeon: you have Piece of Heart #03. Then jump from the cliff to enter the dungeon again through the main entrance. Now you can grab the Iron Gloves in the Big Chest of the entry. Head back to the T room on the second floor, but this time continue straight. Your mission will be to kill all the enemies of this room. Minillosaurs may appear violent, hide in the door if you feel overwhelmed by enemies. To destroy the last enemy (the Popo on the ledge), you have to push the block upwards after going around the room from below, then go back to the T room to take the stairs and push the block towards left. Once the room is cleaned, you have access to the **Boss Key** (lift the stones to reach the chest). All you have to do is turn once again to the left staircase of the T-room, then east to arrive in front of the Master of the Places door. Use the key and jump into the hole. You arrive in front of your first boss. 

BOSS: PAPILLOSAUR KING

The room is surrounded by cauliflowers that you can now wear with your Iron Gloves. The boss just walks around the room sending his children in full pear (eggs that ensue become Minillosaurs). The goal is to take the cauliflowers and throw them on the King. The more damage you do him, the more he will send you hellish spawn. One trick is to stay on one side of the room when it throws its eggs, to concentrate the enemies in the same place, and to go to the opposite to throw the bomb, but you can also quickly find yourself submerged by the offspring . Another possibility is not to ask questions and to send the bomb-bombs following a precise path (for example clockwise). A last way to proceed is to kill the Minillosaurs with great support of cauliflowers (it kills them in one shot), but you may not get away on the end because cauliflowers take time to push back. An approved technique is to cut the grass under his feet: the moment he throws his eggs, a small noise is heard. Just throw the package when you hear this sound, it will prevent him from launching his offspring. Remember that you can let the fairy give you life if you run out of hearts, allowing you to throw yourself into battle. Six bombs will be enough to get rid of this huge lepidopteran, but be careful with the last shot: instead of walking randomly in the room, the King will rush on! 

You have defeated this monster, you are entitled to a new Heart Container and can go and release the first Child of Solarus. 

-- CHAPTER 3 -- THE TWIN CAVES


Return to the Cave House of Sahasrahla and lift the jars and the stone to access the Bow. You miss the arrows, but you will find them in the bushes, the jars or by killing enemies. Get out, and go east by raising the stone and fall into the hole between the two caves. You are in the Cave of the Flowered Hole, and you can catch the #04 Piece of Heart. So you should have a new complete heart. Exit on the right, and go back to the entrance of the first dungeon. 

To the south you will find a stone maze and two caves. Jump first from the ledge to the east entrance of these twin caves. In this room, go to the crystal switch on the right. Go back on the platform and jump north. Do not worry about the chest to the west, you can only have it much later in the game (it contains Piece of Heart #26). Bypass the platform to the left and continue straight to access the blocks on the right. Push the bottom one to the end of the path to free the passage to the second crystal switch. Once again, the chest of this room will only be accessible later, when you have the bombs: it contains 50 rupees. 

Exit the cavern and this time, enter the east entrance of the twin caves (for that you need to make your way through the stones, but the labyrinth is quite simple: go to the black stone, take the path opposite and after the stone you have raised, walk along the left fence). This is a teleport maze as you will encounter a lot in the game. On the map, the teleporters to take are of a different color. In the entrance, take the one to the northwest, then the one to the left of the jar, the second from the right, take the contents of the jar (it contains arrows), then enter the teleporter below to the right. 

You are now in the maze of treadmills. The right path is up, then to the left. So let yourself be carried to the last teleporter (the one on the left) that brings you to the last room. This is where you need the bow and arrows: to activate the crystal switch protected by treadmills. You thus get the Key of Roc. You can come out of the twin caves along the corridor to the south. The button opens the gateway to the exit. 

Return to the village (avoid raising too many stones for now, their loot will be more useful later ...) always staying at the top of the labyrinth: it is the most simple and fast exit. Go back to the puddle next to the blacksmith's house, where you jumped at an angle (following the leaves) for the first time. To the north is a closed door, which is the entrance to the second dungeon. Engulf yourself in the next adventure! 

-- CHAPTER 4 -- ROC DUNGEON (LEVEL 2)


Go straight into the room on the left once entered the dungeon. Activate the crystal switch, and thanks to bomb flowers, go to the other side of the studs by sending it from the blue pads, then go up as soon as you see a branch: the entrance to the stairs is blocked by the blue pads. Lift the two vases, under one of them is a switch that opens the passage to the suite. Retrace your way to the junction, take the stairs down a floor, you will find a chest and a clue. This chest contains 5 arrows, keep them safe if you have not had time to recover others on the way to the dungeon, you will need 4 in not so long. Go up one floor, then climb the stairs to the left. A chest containing 5 rupees is there. Jump from the ledge that you released through the switch earlier, and follow the only possible passage. 

Under the Savior-Husband will always find an arrow, if you miss it you know where to come. Be careful to throw bombs off, they explode on the low walls. The fourth pot contains a small key. Activate the crystal switch to lower the blue pads, then choose either use the bombs or an arrow to redo the blue pads while you're on it. Then send an arrow and go quickly to the right as soon as the arrow is drawn to find you on the orange studs as they are down: they will go back at the same time, freeing access to the stairs. The Skeletor on the upper platform has a **Small Key**. Come down from this platform and go to the stairs at the top left of the room (you have to activate the switch from the orange pads, and to return you will need an arrow). He will take you to a small room with the Dungeon **Map**. 

Turn back and go under the platform where the Skeletor is. As you can see on the map, you can access Piece of Heart #05 by walking around the bottom and lifting a pot (watch the Action button to see when it goes to "Lift"), then go back down the hill. the right wall. You arrive at a chest containing a third **Small Key**. By pushing the blocks (the one from the top to the right, the one from the left to the bottom and the one from the right to the right) you can go back to the entrance. You will use your three keys at once: go straight up and remove the locked block, go through the locked door (westward), and still the second door locked (northward). In the next room you have two Cyclops statues. Uncheck two arrows in each one, alternating between the statue on the right and the one on the left to reveal a staircase to the north and then a door on the east. Go east first: you get the **Big Key** of the dungeon. Then go down the stairs discovered a few seconds before. 

You are now in a very big room. First go straight south to get the **Compass** in a chest, then go to the next intersection next to the jar, behind the two rows of different colored blocks. The orange pads must be lowered. Uncheck an arrow and go down immediately: the orange studs get up while you're on it. You can now move to the next room with the Big Key. In this room, follow the figures in the image opposite, or the arrow in the overall map. If no image is displayed, here is the order to follow:                                                                                     6 2 5
                                                                                    3 4 1


Activating the buttons in the right order gives you access to the **Boss Key**. To retrieve it, head north and walk along the wall on the right. Once in possession of this key, leave this floor to the north. You arrive in the mini-boss room. 

MINI-BOSS: KHOTOR

Khotor is not so dangerous. Watch his plague, and when it is shorten attack him with the sword. He also fears vase throwing and arrows. Six shots will be needed, knowing that the sword for this particular enemy is doing as much damage as a mudshot. The arrows are quite inefficient: the damage is halved on him, so you'll need twelve arrows to shoot him down if you only use the bow. 

A fairy rewards you for your victory, take it and head east. A Grand Chest is offered to you, containing the Boots of Pegasus. Depending on the version of the game, you do not have to equip it to run: stay on the space bar or the action key (used to speak) to light up like lightning. This technique makes you generally invincible, and you do as much damage as a cyclone attack, it is very important for bosses. Jump into the hole, you land north of the huge hall on the lower floor. Head south, and turn on the crystal switch to the west to lower the orange pads before returning to the jar. This time, take the jar and discard it to avoid any discomfort. On the same line of tiles as the jar, post against the right wall to give you more room to maneuver, face west (the crystal switch). Shoot an arrow, and run immediately south. Do not hesitate to start pressing down while animating the arrow, it will be pulled in the right direction anyway. As soon as Link can move, use the Pegasus Boots. You should bounce off the south wall when the orange studs come up. The way is now free to open the second chest: the Big Bag of Ruby (can contain up to 300 rupees). 

Go back to the entrance, for that use the bombs on the crystal switch when you are on the blue pads (or a sword stroke placed at the pixel can do the trick), then take the stairs to north of the room.
Retract the rooms that were locked in the opposite direction, and you're back to where you started. You can now explore the northern part of this floor. Turn on the switch behind the orange studs, as the blue studs should be down for the next puzzle. Then kill the enemies on the road north of the entrance so as not to be embarrassed, then while running go on the switch on the ground. It will open a passage to the north (the key is speed), normally without interrupting your run. Avoid bouncing, this would save you time, so when you get to the end of each straight line, use the arrow keys to the next direction. This will have the effect of stopping net Link's race. This timed pass being eight seconds, a single race (without a rebound against the wall) may be enough to finish it, but you can do up to three races if you
want to play safety. You arrive on the last puzzle, but first of all get the last chest containing 20 rupees: you will soon need it. To turn back, under the jar you have a button that constantly opens the way to the north (you avoid retyping the race). 

Here, you must be able to reach the crystal switch from the passage between the blue and orange pads next to the hole. To do this, move the left statue to the left, but to get there you must first move the statue on the right: the image opposite represents the intermediate step and you have the arrows on the global map to better anticipate the movements, but for a textual description, here it is: first you have to pull the statue on the right up three plots, then a notch on the left, then you have to pull a notch the statue of left, push it one more step up, then place it all to the left. You will be able to pass thanks to the small passage without stud in this mini labyrinth (one arrives at the configuration of the image). The problem is that the statue on the right is now on the path of the arrow, so it must be brought back to its original position. Once done, place yourself under the third orange pad from the right, and shoot an arrow to the south. The switch activates, leaving you access to the Boss. So jump in the hole and follow the only path available while recovering the fairies en route. Stand in the center of the boss room to make it appear. 

BOSS: PHOENIX

It is an opponent a little more difficult than the first Boss because of his agility. He flies erratically in the room, and he must be shot arrows in the legs. Ammunition appears along the path around the room, the catch is that these bridges collapse as soon as you walk. Only the path to the south never collapses. Remember that running makes you temporarily invincible, allowing you to cross enemies and bosses without taking any damage (but beware of rebounds on the walls!). Ammunition appears in sets of four, one at each "corner" of the road. The Phoenix can also send you fireballs ending in an incandescent pool. Eight arrows
will eventually burn the wings of this doomed bird, giving you a new Heart Container and opening access to a new Solarus Child (the door is to the south). 

-- CHAPTER 5 -- FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT


The goal is now to reach 160 rupees to buy the Lantern, because the purse can now exceed 100 rupees. If you followed my advice, you should have at least around 100 rupees (do not forget to destroy all the vases, mow and harass the enemies even if you have already beaten them during your adventure). To complete your fortune, return to the maze of stone south of the first dungeon, where the twin caves are. Lift all the stones, and you should have at least a little sixty extra rupees (there are 3 red rupees in the various cul-de-sacs). Keep in mind that Pegasus Boots can trim hedges very quickly and that a running shot equals two normal shots, to kill enemies faster. To the south-west of this labyrinth is a chest with 50 rupees (we think we can access it only by lifting the black stone, but by raising the natural stone on the right,
we can walk along the trees and access them). If you still do not have enough, go home and open the chest to the right of your room, it contains 50 rupees. 

Buy the Lantern, and first, head for the fountain north of the village (remember the Cave of Lyriann?) Walk along the cliff, pass the first cave with the laser, do the zig-zag trees and you there are). Light up all the lanterns here, then talk to the enchanting vision that has just appeared. She gives you the Super Boomerang. With your new acquisition, return to the entrance of the second dungeon you just finished. Do you remember the cornice across? Walk down to the right. You have two holes that prevent you from moving forward, but position yourself below the one on the left, and throw the boomerang upward as you hurry to go to the right. This technique allows you to have access to Piece of Heart #06 much earlier in the adventure, which should not be available until you have recovered the fifth dungeon. Go back to the west of the village, where you had recovered the Piece of Heart #04 in a hole (the Cave of the Flowered Hole). Enter the northern cave. 

As for the fairy fountain, turn on the braziers: the door opens. Continue climbing, and open the chest: it contains the Bag of Bombs. You are now ready for ... Collect even more Piece of Hearts! First go down one floor, then put the bomb on the cracked ground (you can also recover it and calculate the bomb throw so that it explodes faster.To do this, stick to the north wall and throw it away. bomb to the cracked ground, it will explode in the right place). Go back to your house, and blow the wall on the right (get the money back from the chest if you have not already done so). At the end of the small passage is
a chest with a new Piece of Heart (#08). Now, go back to the first dungeon. Do you remember the inverted C-shaped room (north and then east of the entrance)? North of this room, the wall is cracked. You will find Piece of Heart #07, the last of this chapter. Thanks to the trick of boomerang, you are now decked with a new heart to go to the assault of the third dungeon. 

Exit the dungeon and head north (bypassing the forest dungeon to the left). You arrive in front of the telepathic cabin, continue slightly to the north and put a bomb at the cracked rocks. The entrance is now cleared. 

-- CHAPTER 6 -- MASTER ARBROR'S DEN (LEVEL 3)


You are now in the den of Master Arbror, a dungeon that begins to become more complex compared to previous. It consists of five floors (actually four, the latter provides no enigma and serves mainly transition), including one completely immersed in the dark and labyrinthine. Fun in perspective! 

Start by exploring the room where you arrived. You are quickly more or less restricted in your exploration possibilities: all doors are closed or water / vacuum prevents you from progressing. Lift the only available skull in the entrance hall to discover a button that opens the door just to the right. Enroll in this new room and go down into the muddy pit (beware of Bubble): lift the skull at the bottom right of the square to retrieve a **Small Key**, go up and shoot an arrow in the eye of the statue to empty the water in the basin of the entrance. You now have access to the crystal switch. This opens the way to the next room where you have to go. 

Beware of Bubble, which will never stop tormenting you. In this room, you should turn on all torches in less than 8 seconds. To do this, empty first any possible obstacle on your way, namely all the skulls, and start with the torch in the small narrow room, then follow clockwise. Do not forget to run between the first two and the last three, and use a directional pad to stop your run without banging against a wall, saving you precious seconds. Even if you get hit by the Bubble mid-race, keep calm and everything should succeed. This opens the door on the left, but before going explore the north-east exit. Climb to the first floor and kill all the enemies to unlock access to the room to the south with the two cyclops statues. You are used to now, plant an arrow in each of them to empty the water that prevented you from accessing the trunk next to the torch room. 

Return to the torch room, make a small detour through the pond that you have just emptied to the east, and recover the **Map**, then go into the room you opened with the torch lighting. It is the link with the main room on the first floor. Follow the only path of this room (you can first destroy the skulls in front of the peaks, but this will be discouraged later) to arrive at a choice between a path surrounded by low walls leading you to full teleporters or follow the outside passage . Follow the outside passage. As you can see, the skull next to the chest opens the way to the safe, while the chest at the end of the path opens a shortcut to the stairs taken a few moments ago. Now that the passage is open, return to the level of the road surrounded by low walls, and engulf you in the teleporters. By going all the time on the teleporter on the left, you arrive safely, but a shortcut allows you to dodge a few: count two teleports and take the teleporter on the right instead of going to the left. All you have to do is jump into the last teleporter on the left to access the corridor at the end of which is the **Compass**. Retrace your steps, enter the only teleporter accessible to return to the beginning of the path. Exit the room by the stairs to the north, next to the button opening the secret passage. You go to the second floor, the one plunged into darkness. 

Use the map to find your way, but although this maze may seem disturbing at first glance, it is actually quite simple to master. For starters, we will recover the Piece of Heart immediately. To do this, walk along the right wall until you come to a place where there are five parallel paths going to the left. It should be known that on these five paths, the three of the top are cul-de-sac. So take the second from the bottom (the bottom one will be used a little later), and follow the only path available despite all small impasses. The rule of labyrinths (always follow the same wall) can apply on this one. Try to always go down and to the left, in priority on the left if you have the opportunity. After a while, you will come to the skull that interests us and opens the way to the Piece of Heart. Retrace your way to the entrance (so all in all: always go up and to the right following the wall glued to the skull to the five paths, then follow the right wall to the top). Now follow the big left wall until you come across a door. In front of this door, a passage between the low walls: follow it to reach Piece of Heart #09. 

Go back to the big wall (no need to go to the north room, it's a cul-de-sac) and follow it until you reach the stairs leading down. Light, finally, all this darkness became a little oppressive. Follow the corridor and shoot in the eye of each of the statues. The one on the right empties the basin giving you a **Small Key**, the left opens the shortcut to the "main" side of the room. Return to the labyrinth of the second floor, if possible by the first staircase you have taken to get there (next to the shortcut button, north of the main room). Return to the junction of the five parallel paths and take the one at the bottom. Once again, only one path will be effective, so you will not be able to lose yourself (always walk the same wall if you have doubts), as soon as you meet the main wall of the room, walk up to arrive at the locked door. Open it, and lay a bomb on the cracked ground on the left. As for the first time you did this, if you find the bomb explosion time too long, stick to the wall and throw it to the cracked ground, it will explode in the right place. Jump in the hole, and recover the **Big Key**. Jump the cornice, go up to the second floor, and this time out the door to the southeast (in front of the stairs by which you arrive). Continue your way taking care of the enemies, and take the stairs to the left of the last room to go to the third floor. Follow the only path available, taking care of the Bubble and the Spades to get to the door of the mini-boss. 

MINI-BOSS: MOWATULLA

Mowatulla is a mini boss quite hard to reach: only his head fears your shots. Be careful, because he spits his offspring quite often, and his jumps have (for now) no shadow, it is quite difficult to gauge its distance. Consider these jumps as quick moves on the ground, to help you see a possible dodge. You can run on him (he is very vulnerable when he lets go of his cubs because he stops, and with your race you are invincible in addition to double the damage). A technique is also to corner him on one side, being lower than him, and wait for him to jump: a well placed arrow will cut him in his tracks and it is possible to chained him with other arrows. You will need eight sword shots to kill him (so 4 arrows and 4 charges). 

As usual, a fairy will reward your efforts, and access to the room on the right opens. Go to the hole and jump happily, because you fall again in the dark floor, at the Big Chest. Open it (the entrance to access it is at the top of the room) and you get the Hookshot. These expanses of emptiness and water will no longer be an obstacle to you! Exit on the left (the switch is under the skull to the southwest), you're back in the huge labyrinth that you should begin to know. Walk along the south wall until you reach the switch that opened you to Piece of Heart #09. Return to the entrance (for the most impatient, save & reload) dungeon. So: exit north of the labyrinth, then shortcut to the stairs with the switch activated much earlier, and you're back on the ground floor. 

We will begin by crossing the void that is in front of the main entrance. Use the grapple on the blocks in front, but you will notice that the path is blocked by water. Go to the upper floor. Push the first block to the right, then the second to the bottom, explode the last block and shoot into the statue. The water is now emptied. Return to this pool, and cross again to climb to the top floor from the northernmost exit of this floor. You notice here a button surrounded by low wall on the right, and a typical chest floor to appear. Do not worry, we'll come back to it, but much later (after the seventh dungeon). For the moment, continue your climb of three more stages, until you leave the dungeon in fact. You are now on the treetops, take Piece of Heart #10 and jump into the hole on the left. You land next to Boss' Key safe on the second floor. All the elements are now available to go beating Master Arbror. The button to open the door is on the skull to the northwest. Go back to the entrance (go down two floors, then south), and finally enter the room on the left, available from the beginning but useless until then. 

Cross the expanse of water thanks to the grapple, in the next room you can fly over the trapped slabs thanks to your grapple, then clear your way (platform of right, then of left and to finish that of the top) over the void to access the last staircase of this floor. Note that it is useless to fall into the hole of the first floor. Continue climbing until you reach the boss's door. Do not fall on the second floor, you should go back to the labyrinth (you remember the door that led to a cul-de-sac - that's where you would be). 

BOSS: MASTER ARBROR

Master Arbror is a particularly difficult boss if we do not fight fast enough on him. Its principle is very simple: roots / arms come out of the ground, and will do everything to rot your life. So you have to immobilize them with the grappling hook, but be careful: even if you immobilize them for the first time, they will only be immobilized for a short period of time (as for any enemy), and they do not remain all the time. time in the open air. At first, it only has three hands coming out of the ground, once they are all immobilized, the main trunk becomes vulnerable to your attacks. The problem is that the number of roots to be immobilized increases as his health decreases. Given that he must be given eight shots to kill him, I advise first to immobilize his three hands and give him three strokes of swords. With the health that remains, he will launch his maximum of 6 hands, but they will be relatively slow (because the speed of the hands also increases as his life decreases). As soon as his six hands are immobilized, attack him as much as possible and harass him (never let go of the high key because there is a recoil at each shot), and you should kill him at once. If you fail, get ready to live hell on Earth ... Another technique is to shoot him directly at its first opening four arrows: the size of the boss that all will touch despite its mini lapse of time invincibility, and you will kill him without trouble. Stuff the arrow button and everything will be fine. 

Once defeated, you can recover the Heart Container and access the third Child of Solarus. For a quick recap, you should have at this stage of the adventure 9 complete hearts and two Pieces of Heart. 

-- CHAPTER 7 -- THE SIGNS OF MADNESS


With the Hookshot, new horizons are offered to you. Start by going to buy the Apple Pie at the village pastry shop for 35 rupees. Buy healing items or ammo until you have less than 200 rupees, so you can collect 100 rupees from a safe in Hyrule Castle (this is your last chance to visit before you history does not make it different ...). It is in the dungeons (the entrance is to the right of the castle, under the last bush of a series of four). Bomb the south wall and you will access this famous chest. 

Before entering the next dungeon, you can only stay with around 230 rupees, which will be ample. Now that you are ready, go to the extreme south-east of the map, to the lake shop. For this, from the bakery, go to the screen at the bottom, then right, follow the dirt road to the south and east until you get to four holes forming a square. Here, cross through the grapple, recover the chest on the left (20 rupees), cross the bridge, enter the shop, go to the room north, destroy the wall, exit, and finally lift the stone blocking the passage to the chest containing Piece of Heart #11. Use the grapple to find yourself on the right side, then go see the grandfather in front of the locked house. Give him the Apple Pie, and he will open you to the house of the signs. If you played the game on Gameboy (Link's Awakening), you will roll in fetal position remembering painful memories. 

The goal is simple, just read the signs and follow the directions. Here is the path given: right, up, left, up, left, up, right, down, right, up, right, down, right, up, left, down, right, up, left, up, right, up, left, down, left, up, right, down, right, up, right, end. 

Here are some practical tips. In the first place, destroy all the grass: it will slow you down and it will make you more tired than anything else (you will recover from the blow, with one stone two shots). Second advice (advice can be taken separately, it is not an obligation): destroy the signs after each reading. A sign can not be reused, and if you have the opportunity to avoid confusion, put the odds on your side. In addition, it can open you shortcuts to do that. If you do not survive, follow the map with the reading order of the signs. And when a sign says a direction, you must take the same line as the sign, so the new sign is not related to your place but to the sign itself. After reading all the panels in the correct order, you get the Gold Bars. 

Get out and cross the ravine on the right. Continue a little north, three stones block access to a cave. This is the lair of Billy the Bold. Enter, and do not break especially the vase (it will be useful to leave). Cling to the chest that you can not open for now, and give the ingots to the one-eyed. He will provide you with Edelweiss. Use the vase to start again (you can break it now, hooligan band). Return to the entrance of the first dungeon, and continue west to see a small hill. Plant the Edelweiss at the top, jump into the hole and follow the only path available in the shade (going up, you have to go twice up, then left, and up) and you can finally go out to the north to enter the fourth dungeon. 

-- CHAPTER 8 -- BEAUMONT PALACE (LEVEL 4)


This dungeon is much simpler in appearance than the first, it is only on two floors, but they are two floors with a lot of labyrinths, small traps and passages between the constant stages. The first main room is a huge maze of stairs and holes. For more readability on the map, the first room takes up all of this labyrinth (the inner side of the room). 

Start by falling into the left hole. Climb the only possible staircase, you arrive in front of a chest of 50 rupees. Fall in the second hole, going up the stairs you go back to the entrance. This time, drop into the right hole on the main platform, and before doing anything go to the left under the platform to recover Piece of Heart #12. You should have your tenth heart. For the continuation, follow the indications well because the least error generally means: return to the entry. Fall on the right side of the hole. Take the first staircase (the lower one), and then drop into the hole on the north side. Now follow the path to the south and you arrive in the continuation of the dungeon. 

Go to the next room, there are 20 trapped slabs waiting for you. Little trick: put yourself against the south door, and pull your grapple as soon as the slab enters your field of vision or when it moves if it is already visible. This allows you to have a small invincibility that should get you through the room without much trouble. Another technique is to stuff the touch of attack: the sword blows explode the slabs flying before they touch you (you can also leave your sword drawn). Otherwise, you can always run in a circle. Choose the method that suits you best. In the next room is a huge labyrinth. Your first goal is to reach the teleporter north of the room (under the central stairlift). 

For this, from the entrance, take the first entrance on the left and then follow the path from the top. You arrive in a trap room, with slabs invisible buttons. The path is rather linear, only the southern slab could be disturbing: it shows a wall instead of making one disappear. It is therefore necessary from the wall to walk again without exceeding it (go there at once) so that the wall disappears and immediately change direction to go towards this new passage (or conversely, when you arrive from the "normal" path, from that the wall appears, turn around and go back on the slab: the wall will disappear). Under the vase is a **Small Key**. Return to the teleporter, you're back in the middle of the maze. Now you have to access the door at the top right of the room ... 

Head to the right until you reach the main wall of the room, then follow the right wall to the north. You will arrive at the right staircase. Climb, and open the locked door. Here you have no choice at the teleporter level, you must always go to the right. When the next teleporter is on the left (just south of where you entered), leave a bomb against the wall, on the same vertical line as the cracked rock below. Open the chest after dynamiting the rock in question, and you access the **Big Key** (do not worry about the Map and the Compass, you will recover them very quickly). 

Retrace your steps until you take a non blue but yellow teleporter. You arrive at the edge of the labyrinth of the entrance. Here, a clue tells you what you will need to use your plan to discover the flaw you have just created to recover the Big Key. Keep going and turn on the crystal switch to the north to make it blue. Continue to the next teleporter (do not worry about the safe for now, you can only get it after having the subject of the next dungeon). You came back to the room just before the blue teleporters. Go back down. Now, you will first have to go to the leftmost staircase of the labyrinth (but not the stairs below). 

Return to the big intersection of this labyrinth, next to the vase on the right. Take the path back to the North Teleporter, but instead of rushing into this path, take the one south and walk along the south wall all the way. If you go constantly left taking the north teleporter path, it works too, but it's a bit longer. Climb the stairs, follow the only path available, get the **Compass** and go to the room to the east. Kill the enemies of this room (watch out for the spades, the enemies have a recoil on you) and use the Big Key to open the access to the Big Chest. The small chest contains 3 Bombs, and you now have the Blue Tunic protecting you from the cold. Next step: the central staircase of the labyrinth. 

So go back to the main junction of the labyrinth, and this time take the north path, just to the right of the one leading you to the teleporter. Climb the stairs, and you have no choice to continue south on the treadmills twice. The crystal switch you activated is used to continue your way here, so take a right from the blue stud, and open the chest to get the **Map** (definitely, everything has been done in the opposite direction here!). Place a bomb at the intersection of the four vaults visible from this room, and you will open the passage allowing you to access the teleporter of the cold room of the dungeon. Use your grapple to access one of the platforms on the side of the chest, then use the grappling hook on the chest to get the **Boss Key**. 

Now you have to go to the only maze staircase you have not visited yet: the one all the way west, after the small staircase. For this, always walk along the south wall from the entrance of the labyrinth. You will eventually access this exit. Enjoy the fairy just before the boss room, and attack. 

BOSS: FLORA GOHMA

Another plant. Like Master Arbror, she mostly fears the grappling hook. Be careful, because it always spawns enemies on the ground, killing them is useless (they have a chance on two to give you a heart). At first, you must get rid of its petals around its moving eye, all thanks to the grapple. There is no real trick, especially some agility. Once all petals are removed, Flora Gohma becomes susceptible to normal attacks. Only his eye is sensitive, so it must be attacked from the top of the room, because its tentacles will touch you before you can kick from the sides. Three strokes of grapple per petal, and twelve strokes of swords will be necessary to overcome this flowery cyclops. His death automatically leads to the death of his subjects. If possible, rather paralyze the snapdragons instead of killing them: they stop appearing to a certain number, so you do not get overwhelmed too quickly ... 

Once defeated, you can recover the Heart Container and access the last Child of Solarus. An old acquaintance appeals to you. After the little discussion that follows (and the good old Machiavellian laugh proper to any good villain), leave the Palace and go to the south of the dark room following the only stairs available to go out in the open. What a change of scenery, is it not? 

-- CHAPTER 9 -- AN IMPRESSION OF DEJA-VU


Coming out of Beaumont Hill, you discover with astonishment that Agahnim was not idle during your brief interlude in the Palace. Indeed, you are now neither more nor less than in the Dark World so dear to the corrupt heart of Ganon. Try to fill your purse thoroughly, because you will need it very quickly. If you still do not have enough and you have not recovered the chest of the Twin Caverns (behind the boulder block, containing 50 rupees) or that of the passage south of the Hill of Beaumont (100 rupees), make there a detour. Once your 300 rupees in your pocket, go to the village and buy the Giant Ruby Bag. You have a capacity of 999 rupees now. If you like the risk and hack a path, go to the adjacent Cave of the Lyriann Cave. You will see a very thin bridge and a laser that happens to you constantly. If you are skilled enough, you can pass it. For this, use your grapple as soon as the laser is on you. Thanks to this brief moment of invincibility, a skill of tightrope walker and especially a little practice, you will arrive at the other end of the bridge (this is not the traditional method to obtain the objects of this cellar, know it! ). You can open the treasure chest of 300 rupees as well as the one containing the Bone Key, an enigmatic object that haunts the dreams of many players. 

If you have managed to recover the sub of the cellar, the result will be greatly facilitated, because expensive purchases are waiting for you, although optional. At first, save to buy the most important, namely a Piece of Heart (which will be unveiled a little later, after the dungeon 6). Then, for my taste, it is better then to invest in the quiver and only later in the bombs, because the bombs are much less useful than the arrows for certain passages. So much for the list of races that awaits you. 

Now you have to go to the next dungeon. Problem: you need to get the Flippers. For this, go to the Ruby House in Lyriann. She is completely in ruins. The leaders tell you that the thugs who committed this abomination went to hide in the Blacksmith's cave. Go beat them, there will be in all 32 Blue Bulblins. A trick to kill them in a very simple way is to hide in the doors between the rooms, to throw the boomerang once they are grouped, and to charge them. Once you have taught them a lesson, go back to the Ruby House. To thank you, one of the managers offers you the Flippers. 

Leave now for Hyrule Castle, going north of the village from the Blacksmith Cave. As you can see, the bridge that brings us there is no longer, and now the castle is on an island. Dive into the water and follow the cliff to the north to reach a huge waterfall. Enter the central waterfall and go to the bottom of the room to collect the second Bottle. Get out and continue around the island until you reach the pontoon leading to the castle entrance. The main gate of the castle is closed, so you must go through the secret entrance of the dungeons (under the last bush to the right of the castle). Follow the path to the north, climb another floor and exit. Ironically, you're in the next boss room, but you do not know it yet. Go to the base of the T that forms the roof of the castle to inspect the barrel, and enter it. You are expelled on the island in front of the entrance. Activate the crystal switch, and dive to the left while recovering Piece of Heart #13. Go back on the pontoon, you now have access to the next dungeon, the Castle of Hyrule. 

-- CHAPTER 10 -- HYRULE CASTLE (LEVEL 5)


This dungeon is a bit special because it requires some phases of infiltration (which is not necessarily easy when you're a nag like Link busier mowing the garden than going into a stealth strategy ... Fortunately, the guards also dried up the surveillance formations a bit, so that should be fine). If during these phases of infiltration, you are spotted, you land directly in the dungeon, forcing you to retype all the way you had done, in addition to having to find a way out of the dungeon at first glance. I will explain here the detail of the dungeon, so we get rid of it. First of all, the door of your cell gives way when you examine it a little too much (the first time, the following times it gives away). Then, the doors connecting the various rooms of the first basement are randomly open, so that the path to escape is potentially never the same (although there are not so many variants that). There is the Dungeon **Map** in the room south of the cell on the left, just down the stairs behind the guards to reach it. The most difficult is the last room (mandatory) to go out, because it contains two black guards (the famous guards who stop instead of typing) that cross ... We must choose one of the guards and follow him as close as possible to reach the north exit. A little training and it should pass. Note that it is in this room that will appear the chest containing the Key of the Boss of the Dungeon, but I will return to it. 

Let's start with the beginning. The chest at the entrance gives you 100 rupees. On the right is a chest with the **Compass**. Go down one floor and kill the guards. Blue has a **Small Key**. Return to the entrance by killing the blue guard on the floor to open the door, and turn left of the entrance. Open the door, kill the guards and light the torches. Take the stairs to the north in the great room with the torches, and go up one floor. Here is THE relook passage of this dungeon. A go will be fine, but the return will be much more complex, more because of a lack of reference than anything else. As soon as you are in the room, go immediately sticking in the upper left corner of it. This is one of the few really secure points. You're going to have to do some kind of S, passing behind the left of the first torch, sticking to that torch and shifting to the right wall when the guard is going down, and then quickly go south and finally go out on the left. Once in the room of the crystal switch below, you are safe. For the moment. 

The crystal switch must be blue. Take the south staircase, kill the guard, shoot an arrow in the eye of the statue, and push the block at the bottom, right, bottom, right against the second jar (free the passage by breaking the first ), up to the torch, on the left, pause by lighting all the torches to open the passage, and reassemble the block as far north as possible. Activate the crystal switch so that it is red, push the block to the right, then up to position it on the orange pad, and push it to the right so that it is a notch before the arrows (attention, do not push it to the end or you will have to go down one floor and come back to start all over again ...). Go around the room from below, then finally push the block to the south to be able to pass over the arrows without being deported. A new block is waiting for you. Push it all the way down, then three notches to the right (to be able to pass behind from the same zone), one notch to the left, to the south, to the right, to the north to the vase, then to the right, a notch down and finally right. Stick to the wall just above the arrows to the south of the room, and lay a bomb. She will be deported, and will drop the block a floor lower. You can now leave. 

To leave without being caught by the guard, the key is speed and accuracy. Hide behind the torch in the south or south-east corner closest to the staircase flush with the guard's round, and as soon as the guard has passed you by going north, turn on. The path is the same, ie between the torch on the right and the wall, go up to the corner of the wall, go left and go up. You are safe, but the key is the liveliness of execution. Go back to the spot where you lit the torches next to the entrance, enter through the door that it had opened, and throw your boomerang against the crystal switch (if you do not have direct access) to unlock access to the small room above. Turn on the crystal switch, and put a bomb on the red crystal switch to turn blue once you have passed the two rows of orange pads. You have time, do not stress with the Pegasus Boots. Be careful here, because there is another black guard ... Go first along the south wall by destroying the vases (normal that it does not make react the guard), then the wall is. In the mini-room to the north, you can use the grappling hook to retrieve the **Big Key** from the trunk. Return to the room with the black guard (any arrow takes you there, the fastest is the one on the right), and go straight to the west. You are back in the small room with the two crystal switches. Small shortcut you avoid risks, put back spades and go into the wall next to the door. The rebound makes you go on the right side. 

Continue west and then north through the gate with the Great Lock. Go up one floor, follow the corridor until you reach the room with the red carpet and the six giant pots. Here, start along the pots to the left, continue to go around the bottom, then go back to the right to finally get back to your starting point, all without ever going to the center of the pots (otherwise you have to start again). You unlock the hidden chest of the basement. The problem is that you can not go back (except by a save + quit, but you will have to make this passage to get the equipment of this dungeon anyway). To the right of this room is a chest. Use the usual movement (the one on the top right and the middle one on the bottom) to access it. With this **Small Key**, open the door to the south. In the next room beware of spades, they will clash when you pass. Use the Pegasus Boots from the red carpet to pass safely. Follow the only path available through outdoor balcony. Here, take the north path teleporter, then go to the left to reach the only teleporter available (you can also access it from the teleporter of the right corridor at the entrance, it is the closest to you in this case) you should be in the small square at the top right of the room, only one teleporter is accessible, then take the way down to reach the last teleporter. You have no choice on the last one, and you are now in front of the Big Chest. Using the Feather, jump into the far right teleporter, then over the teleporter to the south (or use the Boomerang) to reach #14 Piece of Heart. Take this teleporter and you are at the entrance of the labyrinth. You can now
turn back. 

Once in the large pot room, slide the blocks to the left (against the central pot), then to the north and then to the left (making sure you have left room to slip between the north wall and the block). Use the torch on the right to better wedge the block, and put a first block against the second arrow, and the second block against the fourth arrow. You can now jump to the left, using the blocks to not be deported. The easiest now is to get stopped, it will allow you to explore more easily the basement. As I said in the introduction, here you will have to find your way to the exit. The room where the two black guards meet is the room where the Master's Key is. To recover it, you must follow the guard from the bottom going to the right as soon as they crossed each other. Retrieve the key, and return to the cracked wall. Wait until they iron, and this time follow it to the shelter on the right of the room. Once the one coming against you has passed you, continue north and exit to take back the main entrance of the castle. A great speed can allow you to go directly from the crack towards the north and towards the exit before the guard coming against you points out. Return to the room with the two crystal switches, this time you can cut through the pen to go right. Open the door of the Boss, and go up the floors until you reach the roof of the castle. 

BOSS: AGAHNIM

That good old Agahnim. His tactics remain the same as all previous clashes. He will send you fireballs at first, play tennis with him until he takes it. Sometimes he will add to the game by adding explosive balls (they are blue instead of red), then he will send three in a row. With each rebound of his projectiles,
their speed increases, continue to send them back until he abandons the fight. Two fairies will not be too much to help you, especially since the automatic restoration of hearts can help by avoiding having to think about healing. He gets angry after five balls of fire sent back into his head, and you will have to send him a total of ten times his spells. It is necessary to be placed approximately in the center of the T to make effective referrals, in particular to the nearest of him and to stuff the blows of sword when the balls are in number of 3 (if not, to stay with just the sword unsheathed in Agahnim face works). For the blue balls, stay away from him while staying well in line of sight compared to his aim. The balls bounce symmetrically, and the fewer balls you start out anyway, the better you'll be. The balls disappear after a certain number of rebounds, hence the importance of being far away (so that they all go in the same direction before you dodge them) and do it in a straight line. Good luck. 

Once defeated, you can recover the Heart Container and continue your journey. Attention, if you leave the game here, the next backup will make you reappear on the roof: enter and leave the dungeon before saving to properly initialize your point of return. 

-- CHAPTER 11 -- DARKNESS AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL


This is THE passage that has caused a lot of gamers, and maybe the reason for your presence on this guide. How to reach the next dungeon? For that, you will have to pass three tests, in increasing order of difficulty. Thanks to the maps provided here, you should not have too many problems. As always, I will also guide textually for those who like to print guides without images. 

At first, thanks to the Feather, you now have access to many new areas, but strangely you will only have one Piece of Heart to find. Start by heading to the village. Do you remember when you sent the boomerang to recover Piece of Heart #06 (north of the village, east of the second dungeon)? Go back and get the Piece of Heart if you did not do it with the boomerang. Jump over the holes, and enter the cave on the next screen. Here is the Trial of the River. 

Lift the left jar and press the button. The pit fills with water. Continue north to the inside of the second pit, turn the knob to the left, return to the block and push it to the right. Follow the only path to the north then under the second jar from the top is a button. Once activated, follow the new path available up to a batch of three jars. Under the first one (the one on the left), a button to activate to fill the right basin. Continue to the block allowing you to empty the previous basin, go down in it to push a block again. Fill the basin again with the north block, then return to the three jars to take the north path. The block at the end of this path empties the basin before the three jars, giving you access to the last button on this floor. Once active, refill this pool (you will need it to get out), and walk down the wall to the east to reach the stairs to the second basement. 

From the entrance of this floor, the two jars hide a button: activate them to fill the two adjacent basins and push the block to the south to empty the basin to the east. Under the jar of said basin is a button. Then return to the entrance to push the block and refill the basin to the button. Push the block at the end of the right path to empty the water to the west, providing access to a new button. Once this button is activated, go back to the end of the path is to fill the basin and can continue. On the right of the west road is the jar to fill the next basin, and you have only to continue to the chest containing the Fire Stone #1. For information, it was the longest, but the least difficult labyrinths. 

Now go back to the entrance and go to the cave before the entrance to the Beaumont Palace. You can make a detour through the dungeon to recover the chest surrounded by a spiky ground, it contains 100 rupees. Just before the actual entrance to the Beaumont Palace is an entrance to the left, behind a ravine of medium size. Get close to the edge of this ravine and jump over it. You arrive in hell arrows. Your goal here is to recover all the chests you will find, as they will contain the keys allowing you to move forward. The first chest (north of the entrance) gives you the choice between two paths: a complex and a more "simple". Use your key on the south block and not the one on the west. It's now that things are getting slightly complicated. 

A small apartment if you have already made a mistake and you have opened the left block, do not panic: take the first arrow, jump upwards, then a jump to the right. You will arrive at the "exit" key on the normal path, which will allow you to get in as you have already opened the exit. Then take a left and we resume from the south path. 

Take the third arrow from the bottom. You arrive in a small neutral square. Head to the left (all other possibilities are dead ends / backtracking). You arrive on a rectangle with a torch, which will not help you masses (no need to light it, my indications will suffice). Take the arrow to the south of the torch (or jump over the arrow on the left, you will arrive at the same point), you are in a new square with a
torch on your left. Take it down. You are on the other side of the torch now. Take the first arrow on the left from the top. You are facing a block but have no key. Take a left and open the trunk. Again on the left and open a second chest. You have no choice, take a right. You can now open the block that sealed the passage. Take the north exit, then downstairs to open a third chest. Take a right to return where you were, open both blocks and take Fire Stone #2. Now you have to get out of this labyrinth. For this, take the exit at the top (opposite when you leave the trunk) which goes to the right. Take the key, then left (no choice). Open the block and take the north exit. Now, go right, down and then right again. You access the last vault (which you have already opened if you had first taken the block to the west). You just have to turn left and go out. So much for the Beaumont Test. 

Now go back to Dungeon 5, but instead of diving into the water on the left, climb the stone bridge once, go straight ahead and jump over the holes. Engulf yourself in the labyrinth of the mountain, and follow my directions. At first, follow the wall on the right, follow it until you can not do anything but go up (all the east of the room, you should have passed four crossings going up: on your first pass to the
north at the entrance, another just after, then two others a little further each time before a staircase). Once you can do no more than go up, do not take the first staircase but the second. You make a kind of S to reach it. Here, the hard part is done. Take any of the following stairs in this floor (there is one on the north and one on the west). Both lead to the same place. Once back on the ground floor, take the stairs at the top left. You will recognize it easily because just before, the wall is a sort of recess. Take the stairs on the left, twice. You have only one possible path, which leads to two stairs side by side. Take the second (the right one) to reach #15 Piece of Heart. Return to the previous floor and take the stairs on the left. Now go to the west of the room. You will still make a S. Just in front of the stairs that will take, you will have a jar location. Continue to the chest and take the Fire Stone #3. 

Exit the labyrinth by jumping into the hole (it is only later that you will take the exit of the first floor) and leave the Labyrinth of the Real Hero constituting the Test of the Mountain. Take the east, enter the subway of the canal, always go east until you get out, make a jump to the witch (on the right of Inferno) to buy a potion, whatever it is, in order to enjoy a new Bottle, then talk to Inferno. Ask at first 100 rupees, because it's always taken, then talk to him again and ask "The black stones ..." giving you a clue about your next acquisition. You are in the Daedalus of Inferno. 

-- CHAPTER 12 -- INFERNO'S DAEDALUS (LEVEL 6)


This dungeon is much more complex than the previous ones in term of course, but much simpler because the enemies are very few. You will have to combine address and memory paths. So start by going to the left, push the block according to the usual pattern: top left, bottom left, and center up. Continue on the only path available. When you pass under the platform, make a diagonal to the northeast (you can not go to the left). Take care of the enemy (I advise to paralyze them with the boomerang, and not necessarily to kill them because the recoil can be more dangerous than anything else ... or to kill them with the boots, preventing the recoil. there is no risk, give it to your heart's content) and go upstairs. You will have to navigate to the left between the two floors until you reach the skull where a **Small Key** is. Walk back to the entrance. This time take the north exit into the west pit of the entrance. Jump over the arrows, and immobilize the enemies. Here, the battle is tough because of the lava: you can not use your boots safely and hindsight is dangerous. Be careful. Turn both torches north to reveal a chest containing the **Map**. Climb a floor, you're in a dead end. Do not try to cross the two spades, it's useless for now. Instead, put a bomb at the crossing of the torches and dive into the hole. Again, you do not have the choice level path masses. You can return to the entrance going east, but no interest, so enter the room on the left and go up one floor. 

You are at the start of a path that you will repeat a few times, as evidenced by the arrival of teleporter next to the crystal switch. Activate the latter via the boomerang or the grapple so that the blue pads are lowered. Do not worry about the chest in the flooded pit yet, you'll only have it a little later. Take the chest at the top of the pretty crossing in low walls, it contains 100 rupees. Unlock the door on the right. The teleporters in this room are only there to annoy you and bring you all in one of the four arrivals from this room, so jump over the first and get off a floor. In this big, long room, do not go down the stairs in the center: they make a loop, and the teleporter on the top floor takes you back to the crystal switch. Basically, it's useless for now. Take the path to the right and climb the stairs at the end of the path. You are on the other side of the room at the flooded pit. Continue on the only path, and when you are about to fall below, here you have to be very careful: you must get as close to the edge as possible without falling, and make a jump with the Feather. This is the only really tight passage of this dungeon, because sometimes the perspective plays against you. To give you an idea, it is the shadow of Link that matters, it must be that it is barely on the edge. 

But at first, fall voluntarily. Take the right (only available path), activate the crystal switch to empty the flooded pit, jump below and jump over the teleporter at the end of the path. You find a chest with a **Small Key**. Take the teleporter to find you at the beginning of the path of the previous paragraph. So take the road this time taking the **Compass** in the formerly flooded pit, and at the end of the path do not miss the jump at the end of the previous paragraph. Take a shot at the crystal switch to lower the orange studs, and go first to the left, take the down arrow, and take the stairs. You arrive in a room full of lava. Take a leap south and take the gate to the east, jump down from the cornice up, take the 8 Bombs under the third vase (you'll soon need it). Climb the stairs to the west, take the chest containing a **Small Key** and return to the room with the 8 bombs. There, jump in the hole. You are at the diving board again. 

This time, since the crystal switch, you're going to have a new speed test: put a bomb near the switch and turn to the right to get behind the orange studs. When they are up, everything will be fine. Note that you do not have to use the Pegasus Boots to pass this speed test. Jump below, but be careful: it's not a gigantic hole you see, but three independent holes each leading to a different part of the dungeon. The right option is the top one, because it allows you to reach both the central staircase among the three, and also to access the same place as if you had taken the bottom hole (the reverse is not true). So, stick to the north wall and jump. Climb the two floors (you have no choice), and head north. Right or left, all paths lead to the locked block. So use your recovered key sooner, and keep taking care to jump over the tiny, slightly treacherous holes. After you have pioneered in the middle of the orange studs following the blue studs, turn on the torches. Enter the next room through the door that has just opened, make the small hook until you reach the hole surrounded by two studs. On the right is the crystal switch allowing you to lower them (a boomerang shot will suffice). A few more steps and you will get (finally) the **Big Key**. But the studs are not in the right position, so drop directly into the hole below to return (still) to the diving board. 

Repeat the journey you have made from this hole, but this time you can access the Great Gate. Go up one floor, and take the northernmost door of the two doors leading you to the room on the right. Going along the wall, you get the Piece of Heart #16 and get a new heart, which will not be too much for the next fight. Continue going east then north. In this room, the slab in the center of the torches is trapped. Iron on (without going over) to open the door and go down one floor. You arrive in an ambush. 

MINI-BOSS: MELEE GIBDO

The boomerang is your friend. Here, this mini-boss who is not one is an attack of mummies very violent in the Zelda universe. There are seven and each takes eight sword strokes to give up the soul. Of course, you can use all the possible weapons imaginable: arrows, skulls, bombs ... Just think to immobilize them with the grapple or the boomerang, because they have no recoil in front of your shots and you can quickly make you submerge by the number and resistance of these enemies. By proceeding methodically, you should get by. Do not wait until their paralysis is over to give them a kick / boomerang, it resets the duration of paralysis. The skulls provide you with a lot of arrows, so feel free to use the bow. 

Once this ambush is done, take the northwest exit and open the Big Chest to get the Golden Gloves. The world is yours now. Go into the room with the two crystal switches north of the room full of lava, and jump into the hole in front of the bottom crystal switch. You arrive in the room with three torches (where you had raised the intersection). You can now open the chest to have the **Boss Key**. Go back to the three glued holes, always take the same path but this time, arrived at the top (second floor therefore), take on the left by pushing the block. You can make your way to the chest containing a **Small Key**. You are now ready to face the master of the place. To do this, go up a room, and just after the passage with the locked block that you had removed (next to the mini-boss room), jump over the lava to be in the right direction then go north . Under the skulls there are some hearts. Go up one floor, and follow the only path available. Admire the power of throwing black stones: they do twice the damage of the usual stones. At the end of the path is the boss's room. 

BOSS: DRAKOMOS

This is a pretty difficult boss, although the strategy is pretty simple: Drakomos will summon small enemies (Helmasaurs), and sometimes instead of summoning one of his servants he will summon a black stone. You will
have to cast this black stone on one of the two heads. Each head has its life bar. You will need 4 stone throws per head to kill him. There are two pretty secure points, it's all on the top left and the top right of the room. Its fireballs can not reach you in these corners, but enemies and stones will not be invoked, so you will have to take risks. A good tactic is to wait a little (he stops invoking his servants when there are a number) so that there are already some black stones on the ground when attempting a raid. If you wait until he is about to spit fire and throw a stone at that moment, his fire is canceled. The fireballs obey precise angles and go in a straight line. 

Once killed, recover the Heart Container with your boomerang or grappling hook, and listen to the words of the guard that appears. He gives you a Superior Quiver (usually the Big Quiver because you have not yet afforded the other quiver at the store). 

-- CHAPTER 13 -- THE KEY FESTIVAL


You now have access to almost every region of the world, thanks to your new ability to lift black stones. You can now visit the optional dungeon (Secret Level, Tower of Heaven) at any time. I can not advise you to do it as soon as possible, because you will get a bonus of choice by finishing this dungeon. To reach it, all you need to do is to go east of Lyriann. In the forest you will see everything at the end of the path two trees that are slightly spaced. There, you have to go a little at random (follow the map of this area for a precise route), as a rule with a diagonal down / left to reach the first point where you see yourself again, then make zigzags to the right once you have disappeared to finally come out on the right. 

In the meantime, you will be able to recover a large amount of Piece of Hearts before embarking on one of the most difficult dungeons to follow. Start by going to Sahasrahla's house. In his cellar, from the beginning, a chest is blocked with a black stone. Inside, you will find Piece of Heart #18. Head now to the fairy fountain, but turn right between the trees. You have an entrance in the trees, behind three black skulls. Inside, a maze of teleporters (the map with the correspondences here). Take the right to the lower right corner of the room. You will find a key under a vase. Jump over the teleporter in front of the locked block, lift the vase and activate the button below. Take the teleporter and lift the first vase, a button below will open a path to a second key vase. You have three vases near the entrance next to the teleporters in the center, under the one on the right is a key. Take the nearest teleporter, two vases: a button and a key. From the entrance, take up then first right, walk along the wall and unlock the block. Take the path down from the junction, allowing you to open a passage on the left. Then take the passage up to open the locked block and lift the two remaining vases (the center one hides a button, the one on the left is uninteresting). From the entrance, go up, one step to the right and again to the top. Take the teleporter, go through the path where the torches were, lift the vases to make them disappear once you have passed, then unlock the block to access (finally) the crystal switch. Once this last blue, return to one of the two teleporters. You are in the entrance again. Head north to the teleporter, here you are in the trunk room. Here you find the Iron Key. Arise. You can make a detour through the dungeons of Hyrule Castle at any time to retrieve the Big Bag of Bombs / Bag of Giant Bombs depending on whether you have already bought the one from the store or not (cell left of yours when you are done Stop). 

Still in the village, head to the Fairy Fountain where you got the Super Boomerang. Take the right entrance, then go upstairs. Here you are in a new maze where you have to push a block (the map with the path to follow here). Go under the first block south of the stairs, push it all the way in these directions: up, left, down, left, down, right, up, right, down, and from there you have to be very careful at the zig-zag crossing on the right. Stop each time a step before the wall, and follow the only path available by alternating up and right. Once against the rectilinear wall on the right, start pushing again in these directions: up, left, down, left, up, left, up, left. You can now move on to the next part. 

Start by pushing the block from the top to the right (stop one notch before the wall), mount it, then right, down, one step to the right, then down right. It is thus blocked against the right arrows which go upwards. The block next to these arrows has only one possible path: right, up, left, up, right and up to the corner where it hangs. Return to the two blocks you had left behind. They will do much the same way, so start with the highest of the two, because the second will pass by here (otherwise it will block). Raise it one notch, to the right all, one notch at the top and one to the left, then at the top, to the left, three notches up, then push it in front of the second arrow (allowing you to jump to get behind the torch). The last block will make a notch to the right, at the top, right, top, right (stop a notch before the wall), at the top, a notch to the left, then at the top. You can now use the grapple to get to the other side of the hole after playing leapfrog. Remember to take Piece of Heart #19, then take the path to the right. The crystal switch will open a constant shortcut. Take the door right on the ledge, you get the Stone Key. 

Go back to Inferno, then jump from the ledge to the right. Open the door, and play the chests game. Here you can get the Wood Key and the #20 Piece of Heart. Remember to save before in case luck is not with you. You have about 31% (exactly 5/16) chance of recovering the Wood Key, and about 18% (exactly 3/16) of luck to fall on the Piece of Heart. 

Again go back to Inferno, and this time dive from the ledge on the left, behind a black skull. The goal of the game behind this door is to solve the puzzle by opening all the chests without falling (the map here). Take the one in front of you, then use the grapple to reach the chest on the left. Go north and use the grapple to open the third chest. Place yourself facing the only rock that is not against the hole, and use your grapple to reach it. Lift the rocks on the right and the top left, and use the grappling hook to open the fourth chest. Return to the platform at the rocks, then go south to open the fifth chest. Take the teleporter south, and open the last two chests. You get a total of 82 rupees and the #21 Piece of Heart. Jump in the void then the cornice and go in the water on the left. While jumping from the waterfall, you arrive in the fountain of Lyriann. Walk along the left wall and enter the small recess to reach a 300 ruby chest. Then follow the wall on the right, always the same: recess, exit on the ledge, you get the #22 Piece of Heart. Enter the cave again and this time, go back to the main canal and exit from the south. Try to make your way through the rocks until you can walk along the cliff of the island, then enter the cave. You get the Ice Key. Jump from the ledge to the right, then go through the rocks to the left screen. You will arrive next to the entrance to the Dungeon of the Forest. 

You should have enough to buy the #23 Piece of Heart in the Bazaar as well as the Magic Mirror (which will serve you a little later). To access the next dungeon, return to the True Hero Labyrinth. Take the first staircase opposite the entrance, then exit. On the ledge, climb the bridge. You can get a new tornado attack by going right after the bridge and lighting all the torches: the fairy will give you the Precis of Fencing. Take a left after the bridge otherwise go directly to the dungeon: in the cave, you must jump over the holes (go to the left) and you will arrive in front of the Crystal Temple that you can now open thanks to the Ice Key. 

-- CHAPTER 14 -- THE TOWER OF HEAVEN (SECRET LEVEL)


As soon as you enter, start by shooting an arrow in the eye of the statue to open the door on the right. Follow the only path available until you meet an empty chest and three Skeletors. Kill them all to get a **Small Key**. You still have no choice, so keep going west to get two patterns on a wall. Put a bomb to release the passage. You can only push one block each time, so you can not block yourself by pushing a block. In the trunk, you get the **Map**. Before you leave the room, turn on the crystal switch: it must be blue. Go back to the second room (to the right of the entrance) and use your grappling hook. Once on the other side, turn on the crystal switch so that it turns red, and follow the north path. Blow up the awkward blocks, jump over the hole (it looks big but putting you on the edge it goes, and if you fall just make the jump, you will be directly positioned), and go upstairs. 

Here you are in the main hall of the dungeon, it is simply huge and teeming with enemies. At first, use your boomerang or an arrow that you shoot from the studs, facing the entrance, to free you a passage. Indeed, there is a crystal switch hidden under the recess to the south. Once on the other side, activate it again so that the orange pads are lowered. Then put a bomb and position yourself on one of the orange studs, no matter which: everything communicates thereafter. You will notice that there are four buttons, scattered north, south, east and west. Activate them in this order. At first, do not kill enemies: you must first leave this room to be able to do everything, save your strength. Once you have the key switches, jump in the hole to the west. 

You are back on the ground floor. Climb the stairs and use your grapple to light the four torches. A small key appears. Take it, and to start again push the block of right until reaching the room with the skeletors. Go back to the first floor. Take the **Small Key** under the vase to the northeast of the room, and you now have enough keys to open popo access on the upper platforms where the torches are. Kill all the enemies of the room (the boomerang here will prove of a very precious help, because they are sturdy enough) to have the last **Small Key**. Light all the torches so that a new path awaits you. Take it and go downstairs. 

Follow the only path for now. The crystal switch must be red. You will have to be fast enough. Put a bomb on the switch, use your grapple on the statue and go on the other side of the studs. While walking, you have time but do not hang around. Carefully pass the hallway trapped by the spades and open the trunk. A new **Small Key** for you. Go back (do not forget to put the crystal switch back in red). South of this room, you can open a shortcut that will always remain active by pushing the block: it is the room of the three skeletors. Now, go back north and up the stairs but turn right to open the locked door. A butcher's shop is waiting behind you: twenty or so Popo are waiting for you to get chopped. Indulge yourself, and then go down one floor. 

Walk along the right wall that goes south, push the block twice to pass and then use the grapple to recover the **Small Key**. Return to the top of the canal, go west and return to this passage its original symmetry. This will empty the water unveiling, oh surprise: a small key. Do not bother, there is nothing at the end of the canal. Continue west and kill the Lizalfos. Open both blocks, and push the southeast statue on the button in front of the chest. In the room on the right, four Lizalfos will attack you. Defend yourself, and you will get ... The **Big Key**! Take advantage of this unique opportunity in the game to seize the Big Key in an original way (grapple, boomerang, ...), because it will be the only time you will see it outside a chest. Open the Big Chest in the next room and you will have the Half Magic. Return to Popo's crowded room, and go up one more floor. Take the chest (the **Compass**), jump below and open the Great Gate west of this room. 

Wait for the evil slabs to settle down (there are twenty: five groups of four) and continue east. The bottom path leads to a timed and very fast crystal switch (5 seconds): activate it with an arrow and use your boots to dart through the door that has just opened. A passage I love where you have to run along the south wall to dodge all the spades is waiting for you. It's nice to see and safe. Climb to the upper floor. 

Do not worry about the enormity of the labyrinth trapped: the path to the right allows you to go down, the one to the left to go up. Easy as pie. Beware of spades, go south carefully. You will see a chest in the middle of a platform. Use the grapple, open it: it contains Piece of Heart #17. The spikest ball furthest to the south only to the door, be careful before you engulf (and especially, if you go down, think to charge directly to the side ...). Follow the only path available and you will come to the boss (no **Boss Key**, like the last dungeon: it's normal). 

BOSS: POUTROXOR

It is a revival of the Phoenix. Seek his rider as soon as you can, this is his only weak point. At this point, it sends you a single flame towards you, you will have to dodge it and succeed in predicting its movement. Once the rider is killed (seven arrows), Poutroxor accelerates and will be more difficult to reach in the middle of the race. His mouth is his only weak point, aim sparingly. He sends a dozen fireballs in a random direction, be careful, but this is also his greatest weakness because it stops and you can send him two arrows easily at that time. You will need seven arrows again to kill him. With your victory, you get a new sword twice as powerful as the old one: the Hylian Sword. 

WARNING: like Dungeon 5, if you save and exit just after the boss, you will not start at the foot of the Tower, but at the exit at the top of the Tower, and will have to make the whole trip in the opposite direction : remember to go in and out first at the foot of the tower if you want to stop there. 

-- CHAPTER 15 -- CRYSTAL TEMPLE (LEVEL 7)


We begin the dungeon with a room similar to the hunt for signs. Follow the directions after killing the enemies. Be careful, they start to be tough, I hope you did the Tower of Heaven because the fighting will be much more difficult in the opposite case. 

List of indications: left, up, right, down, right, down, left, up, right, down, left, down, right, up, left, up, right, down, right, down, right, up, left, bottom, left, up, left. You can also consult the reading order on the image opposite. 

Continue on the only available path, to the left. In this room, place a bomb on the crystal switch on the left and go up through the central door to the north. Pull the left statue to the south and wait for the door to open, then go back to the previous room. This time go directly to the north central passage without activating the switch: you have access to the northern part of this room. Start by going northwest. Two tips are available to you. Take the right / top one to find the #24 Piece of Heart, then the left pipe to take the chest. You get a small key. Return to the previous room with the fence and go this time to the northeast. At the end of the path is the **Map**. The slab-index indicates the order of activation of crystal switches:
         4 7 2
         6 1 8
           3 5


Go back to the fence and jump below, then go east to find an entrance under the fence of the next room. Go up, and you will be in front of a pipe. Follow it to get to the famous crystal switches. Activate them according to the diagram indicated above. I advise against the use of the sword, a false movement can quickly happen, even more if you are not in front of the switch, the sword making an arc can make it all miss. Use a straight tool such as the grapple or the boomerang for more security. The chest just below contains the **Compass**. Activation of the crystal switches opens the door to the north. Unlock the door that is useless and chained directly with sword / boomerang: a duck will go out furiously. The south-east door unlocks once the hunt is over, and we're gone in a pipe. The chest taunts you, you will not be able to have it until later, then continue in the room in the east and raise the skull center in the south to release a pique which hid a button. I advise before to clear the way so that its movement is longer, giving you time to stroll at leisure. Each one his technique, you can also break absolutely all skulls and make this piece a giant meat grinder. In any case, go out to the north and go up a new floor. 

Here is one of the most stressful parts for anti-chrono. You have the order of activation on the image opposite. Start by lifting all the skulls possible, without operating the switches for as much. First activate the one that is the most southerly (time: 12s), then go through the small labyrinth to the open door by actuating the switch next to it (time: 4s). Do not waste time and rush into this new passage, do not waste time with the skull on the other side of the door, it is useless. Go all the way to discover a new button under a skull. Go back in the opposite direction after having activated (time: 15s), activate the switch near this new door (skull bottom if you have not discovered, time: 4s), then go not on the left but on the right because once again the skull is a lure, then at the end of the path break the skull down to activate the last button (time: 12s). Go to the last door that has just opened, and you have come out of this infernal room. If you miss a single trip, you will have to start from the beginning. Once the door is over, you can return to the room without the exit closing. 

First take the south staircase to activate the crystal switch, then the north to exit in the lower floor from the south. Here is the mix of pipes. Once out of the pipe, do not go on the fence (it's a cul-de-sac) and go up to the second floor. Navigate in the lower stratum of this floor to go north, and use your grapple from the edge of the giant hole to cross it to the west. In this room where two spades are going to be particularly annoying, you will have to report a block to the hole you have just crossed. A fairly simple method is to put the block right behind the first line of blue studs, stay on that line, and send the boomerang to turn on / off the crystal switch until the two spades are trapped and do not move anymore. . You can continue your merry way quietly. Push it to the north edge of the hole, then jump after it. So you land on the block, and can reach the left portion of this room without problems. Light the torches you discover a slab index indicating you must put a bomb right in front of her. The chest contains a Big Bottle of Magic Energy. So jump in the hole in front of the slab-index to arrive ... In the first room to the pipes, where there was the Piece of Heart! But now you have to go all the way up this floor to get to the room east of the entrance. After eliminating the Lizalfos that reign in this room, put a bomb on the crystal switch and follow the path to the entrance, not without having recovered the **Small Key** next to the crystal switch before. You have fifteen seconds to make the trip, which is more than enough. 

Repeat the technique used earlier to get to the second floor through the west room (so bomb on the crystal switch, middle door, pull the statue, go through the door that opens, and go behind the statue then fall from the fence and go up one floor, go north and kill the soldiers to return to the brothel of pipes). You arrive again on the platform containing the safe that could not be recovered earlier because of the locked block. It contains the **Big Key**. Go back to the entrance (either by turning back, or by doing all the way of earlier, as you want ... I still advise to turn back: faster). Open the north door then go north-east. You will have to shoot and push the statue to its place, north of the room, but as it would be too simple to do it directly, it will take a huge detour full of pikes. Start by pushing it south and slightly east. Once it is in front of the pungent ball, push it to the right (or pull it, whichever suits you the most, the important thing being that you are on the other side than the spades). Once arrived at the corner, go down, watch the passage with the horizontal spike, then go to the corridor on the right up your statue, follow the only path available, usually it is the one that goes through the path of the spades. You will have to go through the path on the right with the two pikes that cross to be able to maneuver the statue sufficiently and thus bring it to the west. For the passage with the cross of the spades, there are two schools: the very prudent or the bourrine. You choose the style that suits you best, but the case remains very effective for a loss of life sum. The button is under the most north-west skull of the room. Go up one floor and you arrive in front of the "mini-boss", an ambush of Lizalfos this time. Six individuals are to be killed. 

Exit from the west and take the Cane of Somaria. With this item, you can now walk all around Hyrule (except two caves that require the next item but you can eat thanks to the grappling hook). Jump down and take the stairs a little further. You come back on the path you had made to drop the block from the second to the first floor. Go back to this point and use your Somaria Rod to make a block to the right of the chest. Use this newly created block as an anchor for the grappling hook, then push it to the left and open the chest: you get the **Boss Key**. Return now to the dungeon entrance, by the way you want. Jump below the north hall, climb the stairs a little higher and from the wall on the left, use the Somaria Cane to create a block for your grapple. Go back once again to the entrance, making the detour to the left, and from the fence of the hall north of the entrance use the grapple on your block. Then go up two floors. 

On your right you can pick up 300 rupees using the grapple to the north on the fence with the four skulls lined up. Then use them to return (otherwise it will be necessary to retype all the way with the Somaria Rod from the entrance, etc.). The room still on the right with torches in circle is uninteresting for now, so head west. Go through the south passage and the blocks should disappear (there is an invisible switch on each side). In the next room beware of the treacherous holes: the enemies will like to make you fall, and you will be good for a new journey from the entrance ... Go around the room from the west, you will arrive at a statue that you must pull south, retrace your steps and jump over the hole that takes a full corridor despite its narrowness to access the stairs that blocked the statue. 

You are back in the pipe room. Only one way is offered to you, so not really the choice. You go up again in the hall with holes, but this time a single hole blocks the road, or rather you bar the cul-de-sac. Fall in this hole and in the next. You can finally open the chest that taunts you from the beginning of the dungeon behind the statue west of the entrance. It contains a small key. Repeat the maneuver to go north of the wire room above the entrance via the Somaria Rod, but this time open the locked block and take the stairs thus released. Climb two floors again, and activate the button when you arrive. This has the effect of removing one of the torches but only momentarily, namely for eight seconds, so you must hurry to use the Somaria Rod to activate the released switch. Beware of Lizalfos and spades in your haste. You can also clear the field at first and then do the maneuver. Follow the path thus released. The floor below awaits you with a chest of 100 rupees, and a crystal switch that opens a royal shortcut to all parts of the dungeon. You are in front of the boss's door. 

BOSS: GELIDRAK

Gelidrak is a mix between Drakomos and the Phoenix. It flies around the room and sends you balls of flames. It has two weak points, the first only making it vulnerable to attacks on the second: you must first shoot an arrow in his tail, which has the effect of making his head vulnerable to attacks (I can not advise that to attack suddenly his head by sprinting or charged shots to be invincible when he wakes). It appears when you want to climb one of the stairs. You should know that while he is vulnerable, his body does not attack you if you touch him, so you can cross it without constraint (no need to waste time bypassing it, especially since it is a beautiful beast) . The less HP he has, the more he throws flames, so that he can send from a dozen to thirty flames. He has 24 life points, so that's a simple shot to give to the sword (first name) on his head. If you miss arrows, there are reserves in the skulls on the promontory to the
south. If you still run out of arrows, as in the Phoenix fight, you will have ammo that will appear at every corner of the boss's room (each ammo will serve you 10 arrows). 

Once defeated, recover the Heart Container and let the wise old man speak with you. It explains your next destination, but it will not be without a maze before. 

-- CHAPTER 16 -- MIRROR, MY BEAUTIFUL MIRROR


With the Somaria Rod, you now have access to the entire map except two caverns, knowing that these two caves can still be scourged for looting. The first is that of the village with the laser, evoked in the passage of Dungeon 4 Dungeon 5 where we had just bought the Giant Ruby Bag. The second cave will be discussed later in this chapter. 

At first, we will make a small point on what you should / could have at this stage of the adventure. If you made the secret dungeon and followed all the directions in this guide, you should have 17 hearts, no Piece of Heart waiting (we will get a lot of it in this chapter), the Giant Ruby Bag, the Big Bag of Bombs, the Grand Quiver, and finally three Bottles. If you have scoured the village's laser cavern, you have absolutely all the keys, the Hylien Glaive, and you have the Mystic Mirror, possibly with Fencing Accurate (the elements of this last sentence are not necessary to finish the game ). So much for the inventory. You
should have enough rupees to buy either the Giant Quiver or the Giant Bomb Bag. The most useful being the Giant Quiver (the Giant Bomb Bag is very optional), consider it in your purchases. 

Start by jumping twice from the ledge to the right of the entrance to the Crystal Temple, and go to the left entrance. You are back in the room with the mini-ravines. Thanks to the Somaria Rod, put a block on the right. To then use the grapple, arrive by the south of the block. The coin on the right contains Piece of Heart #25. The vase at the bottom left hides the button to go out. 

Now go back to the village and continue to the Twin Caves, south of the first dungeon. In the left entrance, you had a chest that taunted you. Thanks to the Somaria Rod, you can now reach it: go to the vase by jumping to the north, put a block behind the wall, go back to the entrance and use the grapple on your block. If you have made the block too close to the edge to be able to pass then in front of the trunk, you can push it easily. Piece of Heart #26 is yours. 

Get out, but do not go too far: take a few steps to the west to reach a staircase that goes underground. In this passage you are waiting for 100 rupees if you have not already taken them, and at the end, under the central vase, use your Somaria Rod to crush the button (the block to the north can only be pushed once, it again sadism). At the end of the cornice to the east, in front of the entrance to the cave where you found the key to the Crystal Temple, you will find a chest with the #27 Piece of Heart. 

You can collect 300 rupees in Master Arbror's Lair (Level 3). You remember the button that we could not operate on the second floor? You have to enter the dungeon from behind (go around the west), use the Somaria Rod to reveal the last chest you could not reach. Return to the main entrance of the dungeon, go directly north using the grapple to cross the ravine, and go up one floor. You are next to the chest. 

Return to the Mountain of Terror, but in the process fill one of your Bottles with water in the village (either at the fountain or in the trough at the pastry shop). You must go to the Mountain of Terror but on the east side, so on the side of Inferno. Take the entrance to the west of this screen (basically, the only other north entrance besides the Bazaar). Climb the stairs, take guard at the Bubble. Use your grapple on the vases to the north, then a Somaria stick on the left of the wall, go back to the entrance of the cave, then the grapple on your block and drop to the left. Follow the only path available until you exit on a ledge. Jump below, then enter the new cave. Here, a small labyrinth in the middle of a trapped ground will prevent you from progressing easily, but you must not fall from the platform where you are. The right path is the one going directly to the right, then to the north when you can not go further. You go up one floor, you have only one path available so go up one floor down the hall, and there take the first exit (south) as soon as possible. Once on the cliff, turn right, and use the bottle to grow the liana. If you do
not have a bottle with water, you can fill it at the waterfall on the left. Once the liana is available, return to the cave, and go northeast. 

Jump below, go out, on the right you have the vine with Piece of Heart #28 in the lower right. If you want to try the second supposedly inaccessible cave, go back to the cave level, go west and take the cave to the south. Piece of Heart #31 will reward you. If the experiment does not tell you anything or if it is successful, go back to the liana and keep climbing it. Turn left, reverse the waterfall with the Mystic Mirror, then drop off at the first possible ledge just past the wooden bridge. In the cave, turn on the torch to see where you are going, take Piece of Heart #29, jump into the hole on the left, then a second time. In the trunk you will find the last Bottle. Get out, you are at the foot of the West Terror Mountain. 

Enter the cave on the left, pass the small precipices, go around the room to put a block of Somaria behind the trapped ground, follow the only path available. Make a C in the dark room to reach a long enough hole. Fall, then go out. Go east to find the liana. Climb, then go east this time. In the cave, go down one floor. Here, the soil is the same bottom as the hole, so it is by moving that you will see the path to take. Be careful, there is a fork on the end, you have to turn right because down is a dead end. With a little practice, you will manage to pass. Exit, and you will finally be in front of the entrance of Level 8, the Dungeon of the Rocky Peaks. 

-- CHAPTER 17 -- ROCKY PEAKS KEEP (LEVEL 8)


On the way to the penultimate dungeon. Start by using your grapple to go east. You should know that the two rooms north of the entrance are useless, but you can visit them if the heart tells you. Kill the Helmasaurs, continue through the Southeast Room, kill the enemies to open the doors and activate the switch under the skull at the end of the path. This time, take the northeastern hall from the Helmasaur Hall, take the chest (a **Small Key**), and then open the door to the left of the entrance. In this room, first walk along the outer wall to the north. At the end you are waiting for a crystal switch that must finish blue. Return to the stairs of this room and go down. Use your grapple to make your way over the trapped ground and then a jump to the end to get to the skull hiding a button that opens the way to the top level fence. Make the opposite way to the stairs, then cross the room on the fence. Kill all enemies to bring up the chest containing the **Map**, reopen the door, and under one of the skulls is a **Small Key**. Walk back to the Helmasaur Hall, and take the North Exit. Watch out for the Gibdos, unlock the door on the right and follow the only path available (the one not passing by the laser of the blow) to the giant hole and fall in it. 

You fall from two floors. Only one way is available to you, go to the left and push the block. Start by going downstairs: you can recover 100 rupees after you kill the Helmasaurs of this piece. Continue north, and from the blue blocks turn on the crystal switch so that it is red and go out to the north. Here, if you play without sound, you might miss a hint. Follow the path to the index slab and activate it: you are teleported to an identical room next door. Stand out from the south, and turn on the crystal switches in each corner and center so that all turn on at the same time (the one at the top left resets the puzzle). The door opening to the east will give you 50 rupees, but it is towards the west that the continuation takes place. Push the central block again, and go north (the south is a useless cul-de-sac for now). Again a huge hole is waiting for you. Jump in (from the right for more safety at the reception because a horde of Popos will welcome you) and open the chest. You now have the **Compass**. 

Continue your way south and you arrive in the room of the Big Chest. Before continuing east, make a small detour via the stairs to activate, in the dark room, the crystal switch: the blue pads must be lowered. Once back to the floor and in the room on the right, four Bubbles are waiting for you, you will have to reach as quickly as possible the button opening the doors: it is at the bottom right of the central square of skulls. Two rooms after, here you are in a new maze of teleporters. Take the first, then the second. At first choice, take the westmost teleporter. You have no choice on two new teleporters and arrive in the more or less central part of the room. There, take the teleporter at the top right and you go to the last staircase. To go back in the other direction, you will just take the teleporter left then the last available. 

You go up one floor. Empty the enemies room and turn on the crystal switch, then quickly go west to take the only exit from this room. You can choose to activate the crystal switch with a bomb or arrow to give you extra time. Two rooms north, push the block then turn left. In the huge hole, take either up or down, anyway you will have to start all the way to go also on the side of which you did not jump ... To return on the normal way, use the grapple on the skulls. Once both buttons are activated, open the safe in the room that has just become accessible. This **Small Key** will be very useful soon. From the Big Chest Room, push the statue to the top right into the giant hole in the east ward. Jump down and push the statue on one of the two buttons, put a block of Somaria on the second, then enter the north exit that has just released after making the crystal switch red. In the next room there are two fairies to heal your wounds a bit. Unlock the next door and pay attention to the spades: they follow the brown lines on the ground. Use your grapple at the top right to reach the next staircase. 

Follow the only path available on this floor that runs along the ledge on the floor where you were, before falling, and jump down once to the end to reach a room full of pikes (still) and Hardhat Beetles. If you get hit, you can cross the spades directly, it's a viable shortcut. Go up two more floors and push the block below the one to the east: this will open the door to the south. Cross the flooded hall, you arrive in a room with walls invisible only for you but not for the enemies. You have to move forward while doing an S, then in the room to the east pull an arrow from the door to activate the crystal switch at the end. The button to open the south door is under the skulls at the bottom left. Repeat becoming the red crystal switch for the rest, and continue. For now you have no choice and must continue south. Once in the room with the huge ravine, take the first room on the left to find a Crescent. Retrace your steps and from the Gibdos Hall, go east: the orange studs must be lowered. Jump below and after getting rid of the enemies, put a bomb on the crystal switch and go quickly to the northeast to recover a new **Small Key**. Follow the only available path east to take a teleporter back to the flooded room. This time you can open the locked room south of the "imprisoned" spades. Follow the narrow path through the abyss, and especially do not rush on the last straight: at the end is the hole of the entrance. Take the stairs (if you want you can also get a Crescent in the room to the east). 

Back on the ground floor, a new enigma with push blocks awaits you. It is quite difficult, so it is advisable to look at the path on the image opposite. It is important to put the block at the top left first, put the Somaria Block in the middle right, then the second block at the bottom left, push the last block next to the Somaria Block to jump at the end the way, to block the end of this path by a Block of Somaria (making the previous one disappear) and allowing you to push one last time the right middle block to the place where previously your Block of Somaria was. So you can turn on the crystal switch and open the door to the west. To avoid stress, you can also go along the flowerbeds of the wall: you do not risk to activate a button with a misplaced jump (only works for the southern flowerbeds). Good luck. Once all the way west, kill both guards to get the **Big Key**. Remember to place a bomb on the wall to the west to access Piece of Heart #30. Plunge again into the depths of the dungeon to go to the Big Chest and get the Mirror Shield. 

Continue your way to the right once your new shield is equipped, and return to the room where the spears were imprisoned (from the room east of the Mirror Shield, you have to go down and follow the only path). Leave this time the crystal switch activated in blue, go south to the long room with a ravine in the middle, then go all the way to the west and use your grapple to go through this entrance. Thanks to your shield, you can now go beyond the laser. You can prevent the rays from touching you even with the sword unsheathed, the direction of the shield remains the front one (to avoid being touched, you have to load your sword to the north and go this way until you reach the radius) . At the end of the path, on the platform, launch a bomb between the second and third skull. You are now back in the ravine room, but from the south. Head east, lift the skull in the next room and activate the button: this brings up a chest with a **Small Key**. Now you have to go get the **Boss Key**, which is behind a double lock (you have to see the room we are talking about ...). For that, go back to the giant hole of the entrance (at the end of the small narrow path), and plunge again in the abyss for one last time. Go all the way back to the Big Chest room, and make your way back as when you had to activate the two buttons on each side of a giant hole. But instead of heading to the hole, go east (the orange studs must stay down all the time this time). Then walk back in the opposite direction to all the times you passed through these rooms, push the block south and you can access the two locked doors to the west. You get the **Boss Key**. Go back to the ground floor and you can open the boss's door after the big block room, the eye stops pulling when you open the door. 

BOSS: BILLY THE BOLD

This is the most useless boss in the history of video games. It just gets you going, you do not have to move - just hit the sword at regular intervals to get rid of it. Nevertheless, he entrusts you with a Heart Container at his death. And you will need it because just after going down the stairs ... 

BOSS: AGAHNIM

The fight is essentially the same as the Dungeon 5: it sends fireballs and you have to send them back. The problem is that here after six shots (be careful, the sixth shot he returns the attack, put yourself at a safe distance), he uses one or two doubles that you can destroy with a sword stroke (but beware: they do not fear attack referrals). You have to find the right one, namely the one that is not transparent). The balls will quickly increase in number and speed, the fairies found on the way will not be too much ... 8 new shots will be needed to shoot it. He summons his doubles when he comes to take an attack, so do not forget to lose some time to disable them with a sword. 

Once defeated, he releases your favorite enemy Ganon who teleports you directly into his dungeon. You can, however, come out and use the vortex to return easily. Feel free to hear from Billy the Bold in our exclusive interview. 

-- CHAPTER 18 -- TEMPLE OF REMEMBRANCE (LEVEL 9)


Before you start in this dungeon, you can watch the soluce at this location to collect 300 rupees and the Bone Key (necessary to obtain an extremely powerful optional item, see the interview of Billy the Bold for having more clues) and recover Piece of Heart #31 (shown here). Buy the latest upgrades you want in the village shop, and you're good at storming the last dungeon of the game. 

It will be extremely long, you will be warned. In the second room, kill the two Pig Guards to open the door. In the next room, you have to clear your way by lighting the torches to make it appear. If it disappears it remains practicable, but you will not see where you put your feet ... Take the room to the southeast first and follow the path to find a small key at the end. Return to the room with the invisible slabs, then this time take the northwest exit. Again a maze of teleporters. First take the bottom one, the left one and the top left one. Open the locked door. Use your grappling hook to reach the skull north of the new room, and activate the button it hides. Head south. Operate the buttons in a clockwise fashion, regardless of the first. Pass the room with the red buttons on the left, and in the next room use your grappling hook to reach the skull on the central platform. By killing the two Gibdos that appear, you reveal a chest containing 300 rupees. Go to the north room and turn on the crystal switch to turn blue, then go down one floor from the Gibdos room. 

In this room, you will have to walk in twelve seconds to get through the door. No need to run, with all the obstacles it will slow you down more than anything else. Once on the other side, it's left for a new (and last) maze of teleporters. You can refer to the special map that shows where each teleporter opens, but you can also follow these directions: take the first teleporter and then the one just left and one step north of your arrival. Continue north one step then take the one on the right. Go up one floor, then in the north room (the room with red buttons), walk on the two buttons of the center. This brings up a chest. Retrace your steps. In the maze, take the first teleporter (not the choice), then the one just above you, right and finally the two notches to the right and a notch down. Go up one floor and take the chest that you made appear: it contains the **Map**. Return to the room where you took the **Small Key** to the east of the room: the blue pads are now down. If you do not know where to go in the maze of teleporters, take the one from the top then the bottom right. Once in the room north of where you got the key, kill all enemies to bring up the chest. It contains a small key. Head north and follow the only path available. At the end is a locked door. Fight your way through the plots, blocks, stakes and ravines. In the west room, play with the crystal switch and the skulls to activate the buttons under them and bring up the chest. You will find a **Small Key**. To return to the teleporter north, the crystal switch must be red. 

You are ambushed. Kill all enemies to bring up the chest containing the **Big Key** and open the door. Exit south then east, and take the contents of the Big Chest in this room. You get the Red Tunic. Exit from the south and take the teleporter to the left. Take the first exit north into the Invisible Slab Room. Turn all the switches to exit on the right, then go north. Under a skull two rooms further hides a **Small Key**. Return to the room with three orange studs, go to the right, then a room to the north and finally to the left below. You arrive at the Grande Porte. Take care of the ravines in this room, they are traitors. Climb up one floor through the stairs to the north. Follow the path between the stakes, do not stop by the locked door. To the east is a small room with seven chests. Open them in this order: 3 6 2 7 5 1 4. You get the **Compass**. Return to the locked door and open it. Kill all enemies to open the doors. To the west, under the skulls are pimples. As you can see in the index slab, turn them clockwise, regardless of the first one, to open the passages. Take the south, then unlock the door to the east. In the next room, do not go through some places to keep the door open. Always stay further away from the direct path to the door, except at the end where you can walk along the wall. In the next room to the south, you have to use torches again to make the path appear. 

At first, take the right. Under the first skull is a button that opens the door. In this room, the golden rule is to always change direction when a line or a hole stands in front of you. Then follow the only path available and at the end you will find a **Small Key**. Return to the room with the small path in invisible slab, and take the left. You can recover two fairies to the north by pushing one of the blocks to the south (fourth in the left row). Step out on the ledge and retrieve the last #32 Piece of Heart. At this point,
you should have 20 hearts. Do not jump from the ledge if you do not want to start all over again! Return to the dungeon through the entrance to the east. Make a hook on the left, unlock the door and lift the skull at the top right to open the door. In this room, you have to navigate between the two shelters in the right order. Start with the one at the bottom, then the top one, again the bottom one and finally the bottom one. Go up one floor (the staircase is north of the room). 

Follow the path and kill the enemies to open the door. To the east is a teleporter. Play with the crystal switch to lower the blue pads and lift them up. In the west room, you have no choice and must go out to the north. Take the path to the left and collect the 50 rupees, then exit to the west. Cross the stakes to fall into a new ambush: a multitude of Hardhat Beetles will lead you hard. Do not hesitate to use and abuse paralyzing tools. You have no choice, take the west staircase. Jump down into the north room, take the stairs at the top left, turn on the switch on the other side of the door to the north and exit south. Continue in the next room, and go down one floor by the stairs on the left. Talk to the first slab-clue, and follow the directions by changing the floor when needed. Go through the door thus opened, and take the same path. This time, in the ambush room, take the first door. You can recover a **Small Key** in the room filled with lava. This one will be used in the room in the south. Behind is the last Big Chest, containing the Magic Cape. 

Go north to the door behind which is the crystal switch in the middle of the piles. On his right, the Magic Cape warns you that the wall is weak. Take the opportunity to destroy with a well placed bomb. The crystal switch must be red to move to the next room. Head to the side of the locked door: the Magic Cape tells you a new weak wall. Destroy it with bombs and activate the switch on the other side: you can now solve the enigma of the room to the east. The button showing the chest is located to the north. Turn it on and go to the trunk because it will only be visible for five seconds. It contains a small key. Unlock the door to the northwest, follow the path and at the end is a skull hiding the button opening the doors of the room on the right. Continue east and take the stairs behind the blue studs. Taking the first stair encountered, you will open a shortcut for this part of the dungeon with a button hidden by a skull. Go up one floor and hit the jackpot: 230 rupees are waiting for you on the floor (in small cuts of 5 rupees). Turn on the crystal switch and go back to the right. Go east then south. Kill all enemies to reveal the chest containing a **Small Key**. To the right of the room to the north is the crystal switch that should turn blue. Go back to the room with two stairs, then unlock the door to the south. Fall into the hole and take the teleporter north. 

Here you are in the Eagle Dungeon, the first Legend of Zelda. In both side rooms, there are only Skeletors to kill without consequences. Head north and kill the two Dogmen to open the doors. In the north room, push the block towards the center to open the doors, to the east a **Small Key** awaits you in the middle of Helmasaurs. Then head west and kill the two Gibdos to open the doors. To the north, push the block again to open the left door. Enter it to arrive in the Solarus Children's Room, which will explain how to defeat Ganon. Then unlock the door to the east and continue until you reach a staircase. Push the block to the left, and take the **Small Key** in the room to the west. Return to the stairs and unlock the door north after taking it. Here, Khotor just waiting to be fucked to open the continuation of the dungeon. You are finally in the last part of the dungeon before the final fight: in these rooms, you must always follow the arrows present in the majority. Here is the right direction: north, north, west, north, west, west, north, north, east, north. The teleporter brings you back to the beginning of the dungeon, so take advantage of it to buy your latest potions, you should have amassed a little fortune in this dungeon. Once ready, jump into the abyss to face Ganon. 

BOSS: GANON

Ganon is not complicated in himself, he is just very enduring and, as usual, the more he will lose his life, the more his attacks will be long and difficult to dodge. The key word here is the order of lighting torches: you must absolutely light them in the trigonometrical direction, as in the rest of this dungeon. Whenever the four torches have been lit in the correct order, a block bearing the Triforce symbol appears. You must send this block to Ganon to be vulnerable. During this phase, he will surround himself with bats (usually eight), but needless to stubborn, he is invincible throughout this phase. While you try to light the torches, it will spit fireballs with a flaming spill that will remain on impact, like the Phoenix fireballs. As the fight progresses, more will be the fireballs. Wait until he has finished spitting them to throw the block at him. After each send of triforce block that it wipes, it will make collapse part of the arena. When the four edges are collapsed, phase two will switch on and turn on the torches will show four crystal switches, each having a specific effect (the placement is random at each appearance). They can: randomly display objects on the field (refer to the bestiary for probabilities), stop any ongoing attacks or cancel Ganon's next attack, send bats burning fixed points on the screen, or make appear the Triforce block. Ganon has 24 life points, you will put as many simple sword shots to kill (less according to the power of your blade). 

CONGRATULATIONS!
