## Why Donate

The Solarus engine, Solarus Quest Editor and all our games are free and open-source. They are developed by people on their free time, as a hobby. We spend a lot of time working on these projects, and we intend to continue!
If you appreciate our work, your donations can help with the hosting fees and show that Solarus is appreciated.
